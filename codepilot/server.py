"""
Hosted mode.

The local CLI edits your repository, on your machine, at your request, and
isolating your code from your own machine would be theatre. A server runs
someone else's prompt against a repository you host, on hardware you pay for,
with a key someone has to supply — and every assumption behind the local mode
is now false.

So this module is not a wrapper around the CLI. It is the list of assumptions
that stop holding, turned into refusals:

1. **There is nobody to ask.** Locally, a command that is not on the allowlist
   prompts you. A server has no one at the keyboard, so `PermissionGate` is
   built with no prompt callback and every ASK becomes a DENY with a reason.
   The gate already behaves this way; hosted mode simply never overrides it.
2. **Commands must not run on the host.** `LocalSandbox` runs the model's
   commands as the server process. Hosted mode requires the container sandbox
   and refuses to start otherwise, unless an operator sets a variable whose
   name says exactly what they are turning off.
3. **The key is not yours.** By default a caller must send their own
   `X-Anthropic-Key`, so the operator is not paying for strangers' tokens and
   is not holding their credentials. A server key is opt-in and named.
4. **A runaway loop costs the operator, not the caller.** Every run gets a
   dollar ceiling from configuration, not from the request, so a caller cannot
   raise their own limit.
5. **The workspace is per-run and inside one root.** A repository name from a
   request is resolved against the configured root and rejected if it escapes.

What this is not: multi-tenant. There is no per-caller quota, no persistence,
no audit log, and one shared bearer token rather than accounts. It is a correct
single-tenant deployment — the shape you would put behind your own gateway —
and `DEPLOYING.md` says so in the same words.
