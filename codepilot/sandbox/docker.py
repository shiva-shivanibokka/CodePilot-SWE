"""
Container execution, for the eval harness and for hosted mode.

Two shapes, because the two callers need opposite things from the filesystem:

* **tmpfs** (the default) — the eval harness. Model-generated code runs against
  a fixture written into the container and nothing survives the run, so one
  task's leftovers cannot change the next task's result.
* **mounted** — hosted mode. The agent's `Workspace` reads and writes on the
  host, so the container has to see those same files or `run_tests` runs
  against an empty directory and reports a green suite that does not exist.
  Only the session's own directory is mounted, and the network stays off.

The timeout is enforced *inside* the container by coreutils `timeout`. Wrapping
`exec_run` in `asyncio.wait_for` looks equivalent and is not: it cancels the
await, not the thread and not the process, so a runaway `while True:` keeps
burning the container's CPU while the caller is told it timed out — and the
thread-pool slot never comes back.
