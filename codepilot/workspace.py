"""
The real working tree, and the safety net that makes editing it survivable.

An agent that writes into a temp directory which is then deleted is a demo. To
be a tool it has to edit the files you actually care about — which is only
reasonable if every turn is revertible.

Three guarantees:

* **Containment.** Nothing is written outside the repo root, whatever the model
  or the caller asks for.
* **Read-before-write.** A file must be read this session, and be unchanged
  since that read, before it can be edited. Otherwise an edit silently discards
  whatever you changed in your editor while the agent was thinking.
* **Checkpoints.** Before each turn the working tree is committed to a scratch
  ref, using a throwaway index so your real index and HEAD are never touched.

The gitignore walk and the checkpoint both delegate to git plumbing. Writing a
gitignore matcher or an undo stack by hand would be more code and less correct.
