"""
The conversation.

The thing the old six-agent graph never had: every node there made a stateless
one-shot call, which is why the Debugger could not see what the Coder had just
tried. An agent that cannot remember its own last action cannot iterate.

Two jobs beyond holding a list of messages:

**Cache breakpoints.** A coding agent re-sends its system prompt, its project
instructions and its tool schemas on every single turn. Cached, that prefix
costs a tenth; uncached it is usually the majority of the bill. Caching is a
prefix match, so the order is fixed — tools, then system, then CODEPILOT.md —
and nothing volatile is allowed in front of the breakpoint.

A prefix shorter than the model's minimum **silently does not cache** — no
error, no warning, `cache_creation_input_tokens` just stays 0. Measured here:
a 2,119-token prefix cached on neither model, while 7,239 tokens (Haiku 4.5)
and 9,327 (Opus 5) both cached and were fully read back on the next turn. So
zero cache hits is not proof of a bug, and it is not proof of correctness
either — check the prefix size before concluding anything, and use
`cache_report()` rather than eyeballing one response.

**Compaction.** Tool results are large and go stale fast. Past a threshold the
oldest ones are summarised while the system prefix and the most recent turns
survive verbatim.
