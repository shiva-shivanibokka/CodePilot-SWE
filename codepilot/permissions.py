"""
The single choke point for "should this be allowed, and can we still afford it".

Both agent arms route every tool call through here, so a safety rule written
once applies to both. Splitting these checks across the arms is how one arm ends
up quietly less safe than the other.

Two independent gates:

* **Permission** — is this command allowed to run? Read-only and test commands
  pass silently; anything else asks. There is no allowlist that is safe against
  a determined shell string, so the goal is to stop the ordinary accident, not
  an adversary: the agent is running your code on your machine at your request.
* **Budget** — tokens, dollars and turns. Checked before each call, so a runaway
  loop stops at a number you chose instead of one you discover on an invoice.
