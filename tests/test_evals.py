"""The eval's own correctness.

A task that measures nothing is the worst failure this harness has, because it
reports a number rather than an error. Both checks below exist because a task
slipped through: one whose held-out tests already passed on the untouched
fixture, and one whose prompt said the suite was failing when it was green —
the agent read the code, said so, and was scored a failure for being right.
